I am a passionate technologist and strategic software leader who excels at solving complex problems by building robust full-stack enterprise tools and products. I leverage my expertise to drive high-impact results, particularly where technology can solve real world problems.

My background as a Co-founder/CEO (of [Scrub AI](https://scrub-ai.com)), my MBA, and my BSc/MSc in Natural Science have instilled a high degree of learning agility and the strategic skills required to move deeply technical initiatives from concept to execution. I am a hands-on engineer specialising in full-stack architecture—from frontend (Next.js/React.js) to backend (Python/Rust), data/cloud/performance engineering, and optimising digital journeys.

I am committed to using my technical skills (including contributions to open-source projects like Openpyxl [Python], Ruff [Rust], and Gritql [Rust]) to build things that matter, applying my experience to solve challenges with a positive impact:
